SpeechRecognitionScript
=======================

Some of my python scripts used in COSI 115AJ Speech Recognition and Dialog Design.


You are welcome to use and change them.


- changeRate.py: Use sox change the rate of all the .wav file in the current directory.

- checkRate.py: Use sox check the rate of all the .wav file in the current directory.

- cleanID.py: Format the ID in the hypotheses to cater the format rule of SCLite.

- createDic.py: Create a list vocabulary use in the grammar.

- getFileName.py: Get a list of the name of the .wav file in the current directory.

- hypCreater.py: Grep the hypotheses from all the .emma file sended back from the AT&T Meshup.

- loopFile.py: Send all the .wav file in the current directory to the AT&T Meshup and get the hypotheses in emma format.


P.S. This code is written when I first encounter my love Python, so some of them should be cleaner and in better format.
